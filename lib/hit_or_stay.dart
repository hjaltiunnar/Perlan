/*
This is a complicated function,which accepts three inputs,

the current player hand (list of integers),
house hand (list of integers)
the current deck (list of integers)

It should be a infinite loop that asks the user if he
wants to draw a card or stay. If he chooses to stay,
then the loop should stop.

If he wants to draw a card, add a card to his hand,
tell him what card he drew and print the current information of the game.

If he busts after drawing this card, break the loop as well.
